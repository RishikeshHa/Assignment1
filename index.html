<p>We welcome you to tha land of the rising sun "Sadiya". The place is one of the oldest towns in Assam and located in the Tinsukia district of Assam, India. It was the third capital of Chutia Kingdom established by the second Sutiya ruler Ratnadhwajpal in 1248 and remained as the capital till 1524. Here you will find remains of buildings and fortifications built by the Chutian Rulrers during their reign over Upper Assam with their capital in Sadiya itself for many centuries. Historically Sadiya included the entire districts of Lakhimpur, Dhemaji and Tinsukia. It was the center of development of the Eastern form of Prakrit during both the Chutia and Ahom periods, which later gave rise to the modern form of Assamese.[2][failed verification] Its stands on a grassy plain, almost surrounded by forested Himalayan mountains, on the right bank of what is locally considered the main stream of the Brahmaputra river. Sadiya is famous for a flower named satphul or most commonly known also as the desert flower which can only be found in this particular region. </p>
